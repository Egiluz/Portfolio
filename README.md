## 1. Challenges Impacting the Beef Cattle Industry: An Analysis of the Implications for a Southern Idaho Ranch

This report analyzes the evolving challenges facing the beef cattle industry and their specific impact on Rocky Mountain Cattle LLC, a Southern Idaho ranch. The key focus is on identifying the internal and external factors affecting the ranch's operations and proposing strategic solutions to address these challenges. The report provides an in-depth SWOT analysis, highlighting the ranch’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The primary issue explored is the growing threat of drought, which impacts both water supply and feed availability. Additionally, the analysis examines other challenges such as market volatility, regulatory pressures, and public perceptions of the environmental and health impacts of beef production.

Recommendations include strategies to mitigate water shortages and feed shortages, such as using a more efficient breeding system (artificial insemination) and converting unirrigated pasture into farmland. The analysis also emphasizes the need for adapting to external threats while maintaining profitability, proposing actions that could help the ranch operate more sustainably in the face of environmental and economic uncertainties.

## 2. Competitive Analysis: I Company

This report provides a comprehensive competitive analysis of I Company, which designs, produces, and sells AC Cameras and UAV Drones across global regions, including Europe-Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and North America. The company adopts a broad differentiation strategy, aiming to offer high-end, quality-driven products at premium prices. Key competitors include EV-Tech, Go Beyond, and Big Sky Lenses, which compete in areas like product features, marketing, and pricing.

I Company’s strengths lie in its product design, with an impressive lineup of models and enhanced features. Despite having lower marketing costs, the company faces challenges related to promotions, discounts, and maintaining demand across regions. The competitive landscape analysis reveals that I Company excels in product quality but is vulnerable to market share loss due to high prices and limited promotional activities. Future recommendations include increasing marketing investments to improve market share and counteract competitive threats from lower-priced rivals.

## 3. Analyzing Mortality Patterns in the United States

This project analyzes trends in U.S. feed grain production, consumption, and pricing to support informed decision-making for stakeholders in the agricultural sector. Using the USDA’s "Feed Grains Yearbook Tables" dataset, which includes production, stock levels, pricing, and import/export data over several decades, the study identifies key patterns in the feed grain market. Statistical methods, such as time series and regression analysis, were used to uncover trends, seasonal effects, and regional differences, providing insight into the cyclical nature of grain prices and consumption shifts. Findings highlight that while production has grown consistently, regional and seasonal variations present unique challenges. Future applications include developing predictive models to improve resource planning and market forecasting. Ethical considerations address the potential impact of findings on smaller producers and the importance of accurate representation in market predictions. This analysis supports more strategic and sustainable decision-making within the feed grain industry.

## 4. Border Crossing Entry Data

The presentation explores border crossing data between the U.S. and its neighbors, Mexico and Canada, focusing on differences in crossing numbers across various states and borders. Key variables include port name, state, border (U.S.-Mexico or U.S.-Canada), date, mode of transportation (e.g., buses, trucks, pedestrians), and the total count of crossings per entry type.

Using histograms and descriptive statistics, the presentation examines the distribution of crossings by state and border, followed by a probability mass function (PMF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) to assess crossing frequencies between states like Texas and Montana. Analytical distribution plots suggest the data resembles a normal distribution, aiding further statistical analysis.

Additionally, a scatter plot shows limited correlation between crossing type and count, while an ANOVA test reveals significant differences between crossing volumes across states, rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference. The presentation concludes with a regression analysis to model crossing counts based on state data, highlighting notable geographic variations in crossing activity.

## 5. Chobani SWOT Analysis


The Chobani SWOT analysis examines the company’s position within the highly competitive yogurt industry. Founded by Hamdi Ulukaya, Chobani has become a leading Greek yogurt brand in the U.S., thanks to its strong mission to provide high-quality, healthy food, its sustainable practices, and a capable leadership team. The company has built a solid asset portfolio, including the world’s largest yogurt manufacturing plant, and maintains a strong brand presence. However, Chobani faces some weaknesses, such as occasional quality control issues and the challenges associated with rapid expansion, which has sometimes strained its resources.

Opportunities for Chobani include capitalizing on growing consumer demand for plant-based and health-oriented foods, expanding its product lines (e.g., keto-friendly options), and exploring new distribution channels, such as school meal programs and military contracts. However, the company also faces significant threats, such as increased competition, market saturation, and a tightening labor market. To maintain its edge, Chobani should consider further diversifying its products, enhancing health-focused options, and integrating AI and advanced technology to improve efficiency and remain competitive in a market that is continuously evolving.
